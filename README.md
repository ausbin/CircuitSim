Building
--------

The gradle script produces a [multi-release jar][1] to resolve
incompatibilities between JavaFX 8 and 9, so you need to install both
Java 8 and Java 9 to build. For example:

    $ export JAVA_8_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/
    $ export JAVA_9_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-9-openjdk-amd64/
	$ ./gradlew jar
